## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

**#a.Import the data into a data.frame in R. Use the information in the “abalone.names” file to give appropriate column names. (Note: Downloading and unzipping the file can take place outside of your submitted document, but importing the file should be in the submission.)**

*#function to import #inputs:data set abalones*

abalone_data \<- read.csv( "abalone.data", header = FALSE )

*#function to make column* 
*#inputs: name of each columm* 
# outputs: culumn-name*

colnames(abalone_data) <- c( 
"Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole_weight", "Shucked_weight", "Viscera_weight", "Shell_weight", "Rings" 
)

**#b.The data contains information on three different sexes of abalone. Report the number of observations belonging to each sex.**

**# Anser Male:1528, Female:1307, Infant:1342

table(abalone_data\$Sex)
